The `dataset` directory contains four PNG files. Each of these files is a picture of a different sled dog breed.

All the PNG files were copied from Google Images by *right-clicking on the image* and selecting *copy image*.

The `metadata.csv` file contains 4 columns:
| Column Name       | Description                                                                                                            |
